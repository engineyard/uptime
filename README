Screen scraper for SiteUpTime.com

  Issues:

    1) Doesn't integrate with Salesforce. Would be good to aggregate monitor
       results on a per-customer basis.
    2) Doesn't allow for customers not on board the entire period. Results
       will be skewed up for those cases.
    3) Doesn't allow for maintenance windows. Results will be skewed down for
       those cases.
    4) No error handling
    5) No GUI
    6) General code smell
